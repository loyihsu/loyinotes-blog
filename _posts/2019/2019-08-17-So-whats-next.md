Iâ€™d still have to say this anyway, so Iâ€™m saying this here secretly.

Basically the grad application results were not so good as expected due to, basically, several factors, including the final choice of recommenders, documents customisations, and the degree level of choice.

Actually, my chance of a good result was low in the first place (due to the choices of schools) and even lower with the degree type.

Then again, I mistakenly focused on the land of the USA without ever visiting the country, but undeniably, my beginning-of-the-year visit to the USA wavered my choice of going to the country for studies. (I was almost denied entry by the DHS in California but finally got in for they seemed to have no reason to refuse me anyway)

As the result came out, I broke down completely and it took me several months, with a lot of coding and thinking about what exactly I would like to do in the end, to regain my purpose.

With a degree or not, it turned out that I love these app development things so much, but working as an indie developer is not going to pay the bills in the long run. Plus, my family appears to be willing to sponsor me to try again anyway.

So finally I found that the UK, the land I came to like when I was in high school, hosted numerous conversion programmes and these programmes includes some courses that I took interests in. Plus, the schools in the UK are not going to charge me application fees if not admitted. Basically, I have nothing to lose. (Actually it also takes a set of IELTS scores, but itâ€™s not a single purposed test, so ðŸ™ƒ)

So I decided to take on this challenge and try at least one more time, with more experience and strategies. Once I came across a quote saying the brick walls were not there to keep you out, but itâ€™s there for you to show how badly you want to get what you want. (But seeing most of my friends finding there place and way leading to their future still makes me feel stuck here, to be honest)

At the same time, knowing some people that are still struggling to get to the place they want at least helps me know that I am not alone.

I donâ€™t know where this way would lead to, but at least I want to try again. I may fail once more, but Iâ€™m getting nowhere if I stop here.

Letâ€™s realise our dreams, no matter where in the world you stand now.
